# Golang Gin & Gitpod

Fiddling with the Dev experience of Golang gin within Gitpod

Based on [gitpod-io/go-gin-app](https://github.com/gitpod-io/go-gin-app)

## Notes

- Prefer the pattern of combining this with cobra
- Server rendered HTML is pretty straightforward
- Returning simple JSON pretty straightforward
- Can be combined with GRPC + Proto
- What about swagger for generating the modules?
- Considerations about how to organize the elements (cli, server, routes, models, database, etc)
- What about logging for this?
- Gitpod has occassionally issues with the import of gin
- References for things like `templates/` at the top level is nice
- Log while running is excellent

Overall positive.
